#Models to be used and discussed in the report:
#- Linear Regression: multiple & ridge
#- XGBoost: with parameter optimization algorithms (grid search, Bayessian) and without (interpretable: low number of trees, low depth)
#- LSTM (important for the field of wind power forecasting)
#- EBM / GAM


#To-Dos:
#- Preprocessing: discuss exclude observations where: Y = 0 & Wind Speed < Cut-In speed
#- Preproccesing: explain negative power values
#- XGBoost: figure out what a leaf value represents


#Web-Application: 
#- Pages for different models
#- Possibility to make predictions for different turbines separately and for the whole wind farm (all the turbines combined)
#- Include different accuracy metrics in the output (MAE, R2, etc.)
#- Replace wind direction values with nominal ones

#Questions to the prof:
#Is it ok to do the final presentation without PowerPoint (by simply showing our code, relevant statistical graphics and the application)?




#Questions for Charlie:
#Where might negative power values come from? (~9% of the rows)
